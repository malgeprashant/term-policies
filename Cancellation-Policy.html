    <h4>CANCELLATION, RETURN AND REFUND POLICY</h4>
    
     
     <ul class="a">
        <li>Photoshooto believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has therefore
            implemented a cancellation policy. Under this policy, cancellations will be
            considered only if the request is made within 24 hours of placing an order.
            However, the cancellation request will not be entertained if the orders have been
            communicated to the designers/vendors/merchants and they have initiated
            processing them. There is no cancellation of orders placed under the Same Day
            Delivery category. </li>
        <li>Photoshooto does not accept cancellation requests for delivered goods. However,
            a refund or replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality
            of the product delivered is not good. In case of receipt of damaged or defective
            goods, please take the written confirmation "goods delivered under damaged
            condition" from the delivering agency and report the same at
            contact@photoshooto.com. </li>
        <li>The request will, however, be entertained once we check and determine the same
            at our end. This should be reported within 2 days of the receipt of the products. If
            you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your
            expectations, you must bring it to the attention of our customer service within 24
            hours of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team, after looking into your
            complaint, will make an appropriate decision. </li>
        <li>Photoshooto provides an opportunity for you to proof read your album before it is
            dispatched. Only after seeking your confirmation, the album will be sent for
            printing and finally dispatched. As a result, the Photoshooto is unable to issue
            refunds for design dissatisfaction. However, if the product is delivered in damaged
            condition, we can either replace the product or reimburse the product's cost minus
            the design cost. </li>    
      </ul>
